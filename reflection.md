This assignment really helped me understand the importance of method overriding to account for specific attributes or conditions in each class. I initially found it redundant to code an overriding version of the goToFloor(...) method, as the parent class method already accounts for movement between non-adjacent floors, but as I worked on the method in each individual class, I found certain requirements that were class-specific, based on whether there was an elevator in that building or the number of floors that the user can access (as stated in the assignment instructions), were harder to incorporate than I anticipated and took multiple tries to correctly account for all the relevant parameters and conditions. In the process of overloading the constructors, I found it very helpful to experiment with different parameters to logically deduce which were more important and needed to be accounted for in the initialization of the object, regardless of user input, in order to realistially simulate the objects. This flexibility made it easier to create building objects with different levels of detail or behavior while keeping the code readable and maintainable, and helped my understanding of how polymorphism allows us to redefine methods to meet indivdual class specifications. 
To anyone attempting this assignment in the future, I would advise you to plan out class functionalities before coding, as it helps immensely with overriding and overloading methods by reducing the confusion about what needs to change for each implementation of the method. Additionally, it ensures that your logic stays consistent across subclasses and helps you avoid unnecessary code duplication. Taking the time to sketch out how each class differs in behaviour — especially in methods like goToFloor(...) and showOptions() — will make your implementation cleaner and easier to debug.
